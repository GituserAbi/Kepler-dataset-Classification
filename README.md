# Kepler-dataset-Classification
Various ML classification models are experimented upon

The Kepler dataset originates from the Kepler space telescope mission, which was launched by NASA with the primary goal of 
discovering Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. The telescope monitored the brightness of over 150,000 stars to detect 
periodic dips in brightness caused by planets transiting (passing in front of) their host stars.

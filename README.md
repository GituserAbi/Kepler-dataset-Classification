# Kepler-dataset-Classification
Various ML classification models are experimented upon

The Kepler dataset originates from the Kepler space telescope mission, which was launched by NASA with the primary goal of 
discovering Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. The telescope monitored the brightness of over 150,000 stars to detect 
periodic dips in brightness caused by planets transiting (passing in front of) their host stars.

The models include:
Logistic regression - 96% accuracy,   
Random Forest Classification - 93% accuracy,   
Support Vector Machine - 97% accuracy,   
K-Nearest Neighbors - 91% accuracy  
All the model accuracies fall above 90% indicating it to be suitable models for this dataset. But with ceratain differences,
SVM and LR tend to be the best among all the four models.
